<h1>NodeTree</h1>
    <p>NodeTree is a .Net 6 based project that implements a tree data structure. Users can add, retrieve, and manage tree nodes. Additionally, NodeTree allows for easy error handling and reporting.</p>
    <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <p>The project consists of five main components: Handler, Repository, Service, Request, and Response patterns.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Handler:</strong> handles user requests and mediates between the user and other project elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Repository:</strong> is responsible for storing data and providing access to it.</li>
        <li><strong>Service:</strong> provides business logic and performs operations on data.</li>
        <li><strong>Request:</strong> represents the user's request and contains all necessary data.</li>
        <li><strong>Response patterns:</strong> represent project design patterns related to the way server responses are created and processed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Design Patterns Used</h2>
    <p>To increase the readability and maintainability of the project, the following design patterns were used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Handler pattern:</strong> enables easy addition of new functionalities to the project.</li>
        <li><strong>Repository pattern:</strong> ensures easy data access and separation of business logic from data storage methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Service pattern:</strong> provides separation of business logic from user request handling methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Request-Response pattern:</strong> enables easy data transfer between the user and the server.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Run the Project</h2>
    <p>To run the project, it must be compiled in Visual Studio or built from the command line. Then, the application can be launched from Visual Studio or from the executable file.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>NodeTree is a .Net 6 project that implements a tree data structure and allows users to add, retrieve, and manage tree nodes. It uses various design patterns such as Handler, Repository, Service, Request-Response, and Response patterns to increase its readability and maintainability. Additionally, NodeTree allows for easy error handling and reporting.</p>
